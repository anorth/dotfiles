# Let's Build

The agent does the work. The user clarifies requirements and confirms design.

The issue is a starting point, not gospel.

## When to use

- The user says let's build, build together, or asks to build from an issue or task description.

Don't use this skill if the user asks explicity for you to build independently and make your own decisions.

## Workflow

Run in this order. Do not skip ahead to code.

### 1. Load the issue and related work

Identify the written issue or task. The user may give an id, URL, file path, or pasted text.

- If it is unclear which item: ask. Do not guess.
- Read the issue in full.
- List or skim other open issues; read the ones that are related to the issue.

Purpose: context, sequencing, and collisions. Do not expand scope from them.

### 2. Ground in the code

Read the code to build context on what the system does today.

Where the issue and the code disagree, trust the code for **what is true today**. Raise significant mismatches with the user.

Form your own picture of the problem and plausible solution directions. Do not adopt the issue's plan uncritically.

### 3. Clarify requirements

Ask the user questions until the problem is sharp enough to design against.

- Surface ambiguities, contradictions, and implied scope.
- Challenge work that looks unnecessary or overcomplicated.
- Prefer a few pointed questions over a long questionnaire.
- Use a structured question UI when it fits; otherwise ask conversationally.
- Stop and wait. Do not implement in this phase.

### 4. Align on design

Ask further questions that **propose options and trade-offs**, not just open probes.

Point out the key design decisions that a solution would have to make. For each that matters, give a small set of options and what you would pick, then wait for the user.

User answers override the issue. After a decision lands, update the issue (comment or body) so it reflects the new information if necessary.

### 5. Propose a plan

When you have enough context to sketch a solution with confidence, propose a **brief** plan: approach, main pieces, and anything still assumed.

### 6. Build

After confirmation: implement the agreed plan. Keep it the minimum that solves the problem.

If new design forks appear mid-build, stop and ask; do not silently pick.

### 7. Reflect

Load and apply the `reflect` skill to the work – thoughtful rather than quick. Write a message to the user noting that you are now reflecting.
Load this skill only *after* implementation.

Update the originating issue if the work diverged from what it still says.

## Guidelines

The code is the authority on what the system does today. The user is the authority on what the system should do. The issue is a starting point, not gospel.


Update the issue when information or decisions change; do not leave it stale.
